// NOTE: This file is not being used anymore.
// The application now uses the SVG version in DefaultAvatar.tsx instead.
// If you need to use a PNG version, please replace this file with an actual PNG image.

// This is a placeholder for a binary PNG file.
// In a real implementation, you would need to add a default avatar image file here.
